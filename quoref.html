                            In this task, you will look at paragraphs that contain several phrases that are references to names of
                            people, places, or things. You will notice that multiple phrases often refer to the same person, place, or thing.
                            For example, in the first sentence from sample paragraph below, the names <i>Jack Dawkins</i> and <i>the Artful Dodger</i>
                            refer to the same person. Your job is to assess the skills of an AI system at identifying the connection between
                            phrases that refer to the same entity. To do so, you will ask it questions that involve applying these skills, and
                            <b>find questions that the AI system cannot answer</b>. Here are some kinds of questions you can ask for the
                            paragraph below.

			<li> For each of your questions, if an answer exists, it should be one or more phrases in the paragraph.
				If not, please select “NO ANSWER”. </li>
			<li> The answer for each question, if one exists in the paragraph, should be unambiguous. Please avoid
				questions that can have more than one answers. </li>
			<li> There is an AI system running in the background, what will try to answer your question as
				soon as you are done typing. It is reasonably smart, and can answer relatively simple questions. But we are interested

		    		find a question that it cannot answer correctly, please also select the correct answer.

			<li> Once you add a question, it appears below the answer area. If you are unhappy with a question you added, you can edit it by clicking on it. </li>
