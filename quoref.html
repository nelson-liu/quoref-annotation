                            In this task, you will look at paragraphs that contain several phrases that are references to names of
                            people, places, or things. You will notice that multiple phrases often refer to the same person, place, or thing.
                            For example, in the first sentence from sample paragraph below, the names <i>Jack Dawkins</i> and <i>the Artful Dodger</i>
                            refer to the same person. Your job is to assess the skills of an AI system at identifying the connection between
                            phrases that refer to the same entity. To do so, you will ask it questions that involve applying these skills, and
                            <b>find questions that the AI system cannot answer</b>. Here are some kinds of questions you can ask for the
                            paragraph below.

                            with a free meal and tells him of a gentleman in London who will "give him lodgings for
                            nothing, and never ask for change". Grateful for the unexpected assistance, Oliver follows
                            the Dodger to <span class="span6b">the "old gentleman's" residence</span>. In this way
                            Oliver unwittingly falls in with an infamous Jewish criminal known as Fagin, the gentleman
                            of whom the Artful Dodger spoke. Ensnared, Oliver lives with Fagin and his gang of juvenile
                            pickpockets in <span class="span6a">their lair</span> at Saffron Hill for some time, unaware
                            of their criminal occupations. <span class="span1a">He</span> believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs.

                        <li> The answer for each question, if one exists in the paragraph, should be unambiguous. Please avoid
                            questions that can have more than one answers. </li>
                        <li> There is an AI system running in the background, what will try to answer your question as
                            soon as you are done typing. It is reasonably smart, and can answer relatively simple questions. But we are interested
                            in those questions that it is not smart enough to answer. If the system's answer is correct, please ask it another question. After you
                            find a question that it cannot answer correctly, please also select the correct answer.

                        <li> You can go back and forth between the passages, and you can edit questions by clicking on them. Once you have
